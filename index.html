        <h2>Victoria Memorial</h2>
        <p>If there is one place in Kolkata that should top everyone’s list of places to visit, it is the Victoria Memorial, one of the finest pieces of architecture. In the heart of the bustling metro city of Kolkata, Victoria Memorial stands as a reminiscence of erstwhile colonial grandeur.The white marble monument is a perfect representation of sheer magnificence that entices its visitors and leaves them awestruck. The idea of the monument was conceptualized by Lord George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston and Viceroy of India as a ‘stately’ memorial for deceased Queen Victoria, the first Empress of British India.</p>
